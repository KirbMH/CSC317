Description: I implemented it through simple javascript functions and a script tag in the html file. Creating mostly div tags in the hmtl and some simple css styling. I used a few resources online for reference for my code but I was struggling to figure out how to properly implement a mapping function with all the numbers that connected with the input and functions, I hope I can improve on this project in the future because I know I was not able to fully implement this project correctly.
