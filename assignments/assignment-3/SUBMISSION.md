# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Analysis
Writing my own style sheet was challenging yet fun and exciting, I enjoyed thinking up a theme and scheme that I wanted to go with and tweaking it along the way. I tried to use the grid display at first but it was not cooperating so I switched to flex box which was much easier to use. Most of the rest of my own styling was remembering elements I have seen on sights and searching up how to do it, as well as recalling of some of the lecture content from class. The AI programs were not that helpful, first of all I have a problem using them so I don’t want to prompt them in the first place and so my prompts are probably not the best though I would strongly not like to prompt them ever again due to the ethical concerns generative AI raises. The style sheets that the AI gave me was repetitive and had the same sort of look to it, I unfortunately gave the midjounry my html to help it along with styling with the image I gave it. But even then it gave me a bland style which did not match the image I gave it at all, it tried with broken images but the layout was all wrong. I used some of the elements that I was unaware of from the AI CSS because we haven’t learned a lot in class about styling yet. Some of the styling prompted me to do my own research online to find ways to tweak it the ways I wanted.

## Lessons Learned
I learned that AI can be used as a learning tool by studying the information that it gives you but that it is ultimately repetitive, souless, and unintelligent. AI simply scrapes from the internet using other peoples hard work, creative and intellectual property. I will never be willingly giving my information to this model that uses peoples work as its own and gives subpar and repetitive results which have no character or personality outside of the AI look it tends to give you.
I also learned a bit about the different ways you can tweak CSS and all the different aspects that you can add to your stylesheet to make it more personalized. As well as learning about Flex box and grids.

## Preferred Version
Hybrid.css is my preferred version, even if it is hybrid most of the AI style was simple things I could have figured out on my own such as gradients, border-radius, and shadows. The AI only helped me fractionally as I ended up web-searching most of what I ended up with myself.
